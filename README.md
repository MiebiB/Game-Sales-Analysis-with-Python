# Video Game Sales Analysis

This project provides a data-driven analysis of global and regional video game sales, aiming to uncover market trends, regional preferences, and potential business opportunities for publishers and developers. The analysis is conducted using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Objective

To support decision-making in game publishing and product strategy by answering key business questions:
- Which regions generate the most revenue?
- How have national and global sales changed over time?
- What are the top-selling games and platforms?
- Are there differences in regional preferences for game genres?

## Key Business Insights

- **Revenue by Region**: The Western market generates the highest revenue in video game sales, followed closely by the Eastern market. These regions should remain a strategic focus for distribution, partnerships, and localized marketing..
- **Sales Trends Over Time**: There has been a consistent decline in both national and global video game sales from 2010 to 2017. A sharp drop from 2010 to 2011 signals the need for further investigation into potential industry disruptions (e.g., economic downturn, platform shifts). Interestingly, the period from 2013 to 2015 saw a noticeable rebound in sales, followed by another steep decline between 2015 and 2016—these fluctuations may be linked to major title releases or hardware cycles and warrant further business review..
- **Top-Selling Genres and Platforms**: The highest performing genres are Action, Sports, and Shooter—suggesting a user preference for high-intensity gameplay experiences. Top platforms include PlayStation 2 (PS2), PlayStation 3 (PS3), and Xbox 360 (X360), indicating these consoles were dominant during the dataset period..
- **Regional Genre Preferences**: Despite geographical and cultural differences, no major variation was found in genre preferences across regions. Both Western and Eastern markets contribute significant revenue across all top genres, highlighting global alignment in player interests..
